# Sample Blog

This is an example repository showcasing ideal blog structure required by [kriti.blog](https://kriti.blog).
This is a bare minimum skeleton structure which covers most of the use cases required while publishing a blog.

## Basic Idea

Everything under the folder `content` will be published.
To add a new blog create new folder under `content`, folder name becomes the URL slug, e.g. `content/first-blog` 
Create file `index.md` within it e.g. `content/first-blog/index.md` and write your content within the file.
This file will be published under the URL `https://<your blog domain>/first-blog`.

It follows all the rules as per [HUGO](https://gohugo.io/documentation/).
